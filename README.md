### HOW TO USE <<< PLEASE READ!
You can run 'make' to complie everything.  <br>
To run the tests for part A run 'make testA' and then ./testA <br>
To run the tests for part B, FIRST RUN './testA' AND THEN: run 'make testB' and then ./testB <br>
NOTE THAT TEST B IS DEPENDENT ON TEST A! RUN './testA' FIRST<br>

## BONUS
To test our bonus (errno implementation), after 'make all' and './testA', run './errnoBonus'. <br>
